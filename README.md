### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
*This is a very broad analysis based solely on campaign outcomes count *(#Successful, #Failed, #Canceled)*, launch dates, and funding goals.  A deeper analysis is needed to determine more precise trends for any future campaign planning. 
Obtaining pledge and goal currency conversion into a single currency (USD, EUR, etc) would create a more accurate campaign analysis with multiple countries included*

## Results

- **Outcomes based on Launch Date**
  - May, June, and July had the highest successful campaigns
  - May, June, and July also presents the highest trending failure curve

- **Outcomes based on Funding Goals *(based on count not currency)***
  - Campaign goals between 10000 and 35000 were least successful
  - Campaign goals between 35000 and 40000 were more successful
  - Campaigns less than 5000 were more successful compared to campaigns greater than 40000 
  
- **Limitations of this dataset**
  - Marketing budget
  - Type of advertising utilized
  - Geographical location and population of campaign cities
  - Demographic of backers
  - Currency Conversion into one currency type. Conversion rates contantly fluctuate.  *(With multiple countries and currency types the data is skewed when comparing by amounts pledged)*   

- **Possible tables and/or graphs to consider for further analysis of the available data**
  - Outcomes based on length of campaign *(# of days, weeks, months)*
  - Outcomes based on subcategories *(television, shorts, plays, etc)*
  - Outcomes based on goal vs # of backers
  - Outcomes based on country and/or currency
